=How To Do Something=

Reference: https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/How_to_write_a_HOWTO

Summarize your article here so readers can decide
quickly whether to read it.

=Before You Start Title=
Your readers might need to get ready before they can do the work.
If so explain those prerequisites first. This section might alternatively 
contain background information readers need to know before they can make 
sense of your example or carry out your instructions.

=Doing Something Title=
Write the steps of how to do something in this section.
If possible, show an example first, then tell your readers the steps.
Break this procedure into separate procedures to avoid more than
about 7-9 steps per procedure.

 INSERT GREAT EXAMPLE HERE

#Write up the steps to do it.
#Write the background info/prerequisites readers need.
